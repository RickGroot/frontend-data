# Research topic
Are parking garages in The Netherlands high enough for people on vacation.

## Sub-topics
In which area's are more low parking garages?  
Are there many parking garages outside cities?  

## Required variables
* ID of parking space
* Location of parking garages
* Capacity and other garage information, for better visualisation
* Maximumheight of parking garage
* Data of car types, like height and/or type    

All this data is from RDW datasets. For location of parking garages I use [GEO Parkeer Garages](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/GEO-Parkeer-Garages/t5pc-eb34), and for capacity and maximumvehicleheight I use [Open Data Parkeren: SPECIFICATIES PARKEERGEBIED](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s). The datasets I am going to use for the car data are still unknown.

## Expectations
I think that lots of parking garages are perfectly compatible with most cars. But if you are on a vacation there could be a problem with some garages. I think that people with a roof box, or people who travel long distances in a travel van could be in trouble with some parking garages, because these vehicles are often higher.

### Sub-topic expectations
I think there are more low parking garages in older cities, because back then they might not have thought of taller vehicles. I also think there won't be many parking garages outside cities, because there is no need for them, and there is more space for regular parking lots.

# Concept
A map with all parking garages, with information about capacity and maximum vehicle heights. You can also filter the garages by filtering on your car height or car type, combined with a bar graph which contains the heights of parking garages, and the amount of these heights.
